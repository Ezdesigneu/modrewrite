# modrewrite
PHP modrewrite created by EZdesign

These days every website, big or small uses mod rewrite to get nice looking urls like www.test.com/news/ instead of www.test.com/index.php?page=news. If you use CMS systems like Wordpress or Drupal it's very easy. You can just enable this option and you're ready. But if your are writing you own applications or websites it's an whole other story. In these cases you need to get dirty with htaccess and stuff, and as you might know, that's not a fun thing to do. With this class the needed htaccess is automaticly generated. The rest of the rewriting is done by defining the needed url's in php.
